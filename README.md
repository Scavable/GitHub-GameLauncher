# GitHub-Test
First project using Git.

This project is a game launcher by taking in a folder with shortcuts to games and populating the window with them.
When you click on a game tile the file associated with that game tile is opened/executed, starting the game up.
You will have the options to sort Ascending or Descending and be able to change the game tile font color and background color.
